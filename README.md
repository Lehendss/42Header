# 42Header
Standar "42 School" Header configured with Lua and nvim commands, for personal purpose

"42Header" is located in my ".config/nvim/init.lua" file

------------------To use it---------------
I named the 'function' "insertHeader()"

So, once I create a ".c" file, I call the function with lua.

Type.

":lua insertHeader()"

So there it is.
